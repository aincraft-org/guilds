  # Costs are procedurally generated per guild using weighted probability selection
  # Materials are defined via API with level ranges and probability curves
  # Defaults include:
  #   - Common materials (levels 1-50): Iron, Coal, Copper, Cobblestone, etc.
  #   - Uncommon materials (levels 20-75): Gold, Redstone, Lapis, Quartz, etc.
  #   - Rare materials (levels 40-100): Diamond, Emerald, Ender Pearl, etc.
  #   - Very rare materials (levels 70-100): Netherite, Nether Star, etc.
  #
  # Use the MaterialRegistry API to register custom materials with:
  #   - minLevel: Minimum guild level for material to appear
  #   - maxLevel: Maximum guild level for material to appear
  #   - baseAmount: Base quantity before exponential scaling
  #   - probability: Selection weight (higher = more likely)
